## üñºÔ∏è Image Inclusion Analysis

| Query | Simple Prompt | Complex Prompt |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| Trace LLM calls | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Weave Dataset | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Evaluation playground | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| weave.Model tracking | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Tracing example | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| Create dataset | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |

**Result**: Complex prompt includes images in **5 out of 6 queries (83.3%)**

---

## üí° Key Insights

### 1. **Image Inclusion is Critical**
- Simple prompt: **0% image inclusion**
- Complex prompt: **83.3% image inclusion**
- Images account for **40 points** out of 100 in scoring

### 2. **Complex Prompt Provides Consistency**
- 5 out of 6 queries scored **100%** with complex prompt
- Only 1 query failed to include images (Query 5)
- Simple prompt never included images

### 3. **Response Quality Improved**
- Complex prompt responses are more concise (150-400 words)
- Simple prompt sometimes too verbose (528 words max)
- Complex prompt better at meeting expectations

### 4. **One Edge Case**
- Query 5: "Explain Weave tracing and show me an example"
- Both prompts failed to include images (20% score)
- Possible reason: Query asks to "show me an example" which might confuse the model

## üéØ Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Production Deployment

**Use the complex prompt:**

```python
PRODUCTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a helpful AI assistant that provides information about Weave, W&B's LLM observability framework.

IMPORTANT: Always include relevant screenshots and diagrams in your responses using markdown format: ![alt text](image_url)

When answering questions:
1. Provide clear text explanations
2. Include at least one relevant image/screenshot from the Weave documentation
3. Use the format: ![description](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/assets/images/...)
4. Explain why the image is relevant

Example response format:
"Here's how to use Weave tracing:

[Your explanation here]

![Weave Trace UI](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/assets/images/trace-example.png)

This screenshot shows the trace interface where you can see..."
"""
```

**Settings:**
- Temperature: 0.3
- Max tokens: 600-800
- Model: openpipe:multimodal-agent-v1

### üîß Future Improvements

1. **Investigate Query 5 failure**
   - Why did both prompts fail on "show me an example"?
   - Consider adding more training examples with "show me" phrasing

2. **Monitor edge cases**
   - Track queries that don't include images
   - Collect user feedback on image relevance

3. **A/B Testing**
   - Deploy both prompts to small user segments
   - Measure user satisfaction and engagement

4. **Continuous Evaluation**
   - Run this evaluation weekly
   - Track performance over time
   - Adjust prompt based on real user queries
