      "response": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking how to trace their LLM calls with Weave. Let me start by recalling what Weave is. It's a service that allows developers to track and manage their LLM calls. So, the user wants to know how to trace them.\n\nFirst, I need to explain the process. Maybe start by mentioning that Weave provides tools like a traceable LLM, which is a service that tracks the LLM's execution. Then, provide examples of how to do this. For instance, using a traceable LLM would mean that the user can track their model's behavior, like the input, output, and processing steps.\n\nWait, but how exactly does that work? Maybe explain that by using Weave's traceable LLM, developers can see the LLM's history, including the input and output. Also, include images. So, perhaps a diagram showing the traceable LLM with input and output steps. But since I can't create images, I'll describe them as visual examples.\n\nNext, maybe mention that Weave's traceable LLM is a service that allows tracking, so the user can see the LLM's execution. Then, provide examples like using a traceable LLM to track the model's behavior, which can be visualized as a timeline of input and output.\n\nI should also check if there are any other steps involved. Maybe explain that once the LLM is used, the traceable LLM can be used to track the model's performance, such as monitoring latency or accuracy. Also, include examples like using a traceable LLM to track a specific model's output, which can be visualized as a graph showing input and output.\n\nWait, but the user asked specifically for tracing LLM calls. So, the key here is to focus on that aspect. Maybe also mention that Weave's traceable LLM is a service that allows developers to track their model's execution, which can be done through various tools like a traceable LLM, which is a service that allows tracking.\n\nI need to make sure the explanation is clear and that the examples are practical. Also, check if there's any confusion between the service name and the actual process. For example, the user might be using Weave's traceable LLM, so the answer should directly relate to that.\n\nFinally, wrap it up by summarizing the steps and providing a brief example. Make sure the answer is structured, with each part clearly explained and examples included.\n</think>\n\nTo trace your **LLM calls** with **Weave**, you can leverage its **traceable LLM service**, which allows you to track the execution of your model's behavior.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking how to trace their LLM calls using Weave. They want relevant images and examples. Let me start by recalling what Weave does. From previous interactions, they've been using comparison views for object ordering, which makes sense because Weave allows users to track and reorder objects.\n\nFirst, I need to outline the main steps. The user mentioned tracing LLM calls, so maybe they're tracking their model's execution. In previous examples, they had a topbar with an ID that can be reordered. So perhaps tracing involves selecting the object and dragging it into the left or right position in the comparison view.\n\nI should explain each step clearly. For example, in the Comparison view topbar, mouse over the ID to set it as baseline, then reorder it. Then, when they click on the diff value, the format changes. Also, including images from previous examples would help. Maybe mention that after setting the order, the UI refreshes with an updated comparison.\n\nWait, the user might not know how to set up the baseline. So step-by-step: mouse over ID, select Make baseline, then reorder. Then display the diff as integer or percentage. Also, maybe include a note about using this for tracking model execution, which ties back to tracing LLM calls.\n\nI should make sure the examples are clear and that the images referenced in the previous answers are correctly linked. Also, check if there's any confusion between numeric values and their display formats. Since they mentioned changing from integer to percentage, maybe explain that positive numbers show as multipliers.\n\nFinally, wrap it up by summarizing all steps and confirming that this setup helps trace LLM calls effectively.\n</think>\n\nTo trace your **LLM (Large Language Model) calls** using Weave, follow these steps with relevant examples and images:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Set a Baseline in the Comparison View**\n- In the **Comparison view topbar**, **mouse over the ID** you want to set as the baseline.\n- Click the **three dots** (or right-click) to open the menu.\n- Select **\"Make baseline\"** \u2192 The UI refreshes, and the baseline object is now furthest left in the topbar.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Reorder Objects**\n- Drag the ID from its current position to the desired order (left or right).\n- Place it in the updated ordering \u2192 The UI updates with an improved comparison view.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Display Numeric Diff as Integer/Percentage**\n- After setting the order, click on the diff value.\n- It will automatically update to either:\n  - An integer (for exact values)\n  - A percentage (for relative differences)\n\n**Example:**  \nIf your model output is `completion_tokens = 1234`, the diff shows as **`1234`**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Viewing Diff Formats**\n- Positive numeric values are displayed as **multipliers**, which helps track how much of the output was generated by the model.\n\n---\n\n### Example Workflow (with Images)\n![Baseline Set](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/assets/images/comparison-2objs-baseline-set-65ad9564e7d5c2cba6ec164ed9945bd0.png)  \n**Step 1:** Mouse over ID \u2192 **Make baseline**.  \n\n![Reorder Object](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/assets/images/comparison-2objs-reorder-e261f53b1ef7fee76da193e15fb02585.png)  \n**Step 2:** Drag to left/right \u2192 Update ordering.  \n\n![Diff Format Updated](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/assets/images/comparison-2objs-numericdiffformat-updated-0a27bede143a14a4ceb80104ee506a16.png)  \n**Step 3:** Click diff \u2192 Format changes.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary\nBy using Weave\u2019s **Comparison view**, you can trace and reorder LLM calls, track numeric diff formats, and visualize your model execution with precision. This helps identify how much of the output was generated by the model, making it easier to debug or analyze performance.",

      "response": "Weave is a powerful tool for debugging and profiling applications. However, it seems there might be some confusion in your question as Weave is a networking solution for Docker containers and doesn't directly deal with LLM (Low Level Memory) calls. \n\nWeave creates a virtual network that connects Docker containers deployed across multiple hosts. It allows you to establish network connectivity among Docker containers without modifying their applications.\n\nIf you are looking to trace or debug memory calls, you might want to consider tools like Valgrind, gdb, or specific tools available for your programming language. \n\nIf you are looking for tracing system calls, you might want to use strace or ltrace in Linux. \n\nIf you are indeed looking to trace network calls between Docker containers orchestrated by Weave, you might want to use network monitoring and debugging tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, etc. \n\nPlease clarify your question further so we can provide a more accurate answer.",
