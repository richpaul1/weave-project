# RL Strategy and Execution Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Objective

**Goal**: Train a custom multimodal agent that intelligently returns both text and images when appropriate, creating a more comprehensive and helpful user experience.

**Vision**: Transform your current text-only RAG agent into a multimodal assistant that can:
- Automatically detect when visual aids would enhance responses
- Search and select the most relevant images from your knowledge base
- Provide structured responses combining text explanations with visual illustrations
- Explain the reasoning behind image selections

## ðŸ“‹ Strategic Framework

### Phase 1: Foundation & Data Collection
**Objective**: Build a robust training dataset from existing documentation

**Strategy**:
- Leverage existing markdown documentation as training source
- Extract high-quality text-image pairs with confidence scoring
- Focus on documentation patterns where images enhance understanding
- Prioritize screenshots, diagrams, and instructional visuals

**Success Metrics**:
- âœ… Extract 10+ high-quality training pairs (achieved: 13 pairs, 0.92 avg confidence)
- âœ… Achieve >80% confidence score on training data
- âœ… Cover diverse image types (screenshots, diagrams, badges)

### Phase 2: Model Training & Optimization
**Objective**: Train the agent using reinforcement learning to make intelligent multimodal decisions

**Strategy**:
- Use OpenPipe ART for efficient RL training with RULER scoring
- Implement custom reward function based on multimodal quality metrics
- Train on structured JSON responses with text, images, and reasoning
- Leverage Weave for comprehensive training observability

**Success Metrics**:
- Model converges with improving reward scores
- Agent learns to include relevant images 80%+ of the time
- Response quality maintains or improves with image additions
- Training completes within reasonable time/cost constraints

### Phase 3: Integration & Deployment - Left For Later Phase
**Objective**: Seamlessly integrate the trained model into the existing agent system

**Strategy**: Future State
- Implement image search tool as part of agent's toolkit
- Modify response parsing to handle multimodal outputs
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing text-only flows
- Add configuration toggles for multimodal features

**Success Metrics**:
- Zero downtime deployment
- Existing functionality remains unaffected
- New multimodal responses enhance user experience
- Performance impact <10% on response time

## ðŸš€ Execution Plan

### Step 1: Environment Setup & Validation
```bash
# 1. Verify current setup
cd rl
python run_training.py --test-only

# 2. Install training dependencies
pip install openpipe-art[backend,langgraph]
pip install weave wandb

# 3. Configure environment variables
export WANDB_API_KEY="your-wandb-key"
export WANDB_PROJECT="multimodal-agent-training"
```


### Step 2: Data Analysis & Preparation
```bash
# 1. Run comprehensive data analysis
python run_training.py --data-only

# 2. Review training data quality
cat training_data.json | jq '.[] | select(.confidence_score > 0.7)'

# 3. Expand dataset if needed
# - Crawl additional documentation sites
# - Add more markdown files with images
# - Manually curate high-quality examples
```

### Step 3: Training Pipeline Execution
```bash
# 1. Configure training parameters
vim multimodal_agent_config.json

# 2. Start training with monitoring
python run_training.py

# 3. Monitor progress in Weave dashboard
 - Track reward convergence
 - Monitor training metrics
 - Debug failed examples
```

### Step 4: Model Evaluation & Testing
```bash
# 1. Test trained model on held-out examples
python evaluate_model.py --model-path ./models/multimodal-agent

# 2. Manual quality assessment
python test_multimodal_responses.py --interactive

# 3. A/B testing preparation
# - Deploy to staging environment
# - Create test scenarios
# - Define success metrics
```
