================================================================================USER: Based on this Weave documentation context: Now after calling `.invoke` you can see the trace in Weave **now tracks the model parameters as well as the code** for the model functions that have been decorated with `weave.op()`. You can see the model is also versioned, "v21" in this case, and if you click on the model **you can see all of the calls** that have used that version of the model
ASSISTANT: **A note on using `weave.Model`:**

USER: Based on this Weave documentation context: In this example, we'll show how W&B Weave can track a RAG application that has a retrieval step to get documents. By tracking this, you can debug your app and see what documents were pulled into the LLM context. We'll also show how to evaluate it using an LLM judge.
ASSISTANT: Check out the [RAG++ course](https://www.wandb.courses/courses/rag-in-production?utm_source=wandb_docs&utm_medium=code&utm_campaign=weave_docs) for a more advanced dive into practical RAG techniques for engineers, where you'll learn production-ready solutions from Weights & Biases, Cohere and Weaviate to optimize performance, cut costs, and enhance the accuracy and relevance of your applications.
