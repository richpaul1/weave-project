Let me start by recalling what I know about Weave.\n\nFirst, Weave is a tool for evaluating machine learning models, right? It's used in the context of model training pipelines. The user mentioned \"evaluation framework,\" so I should explain that part clearly. They probably want to know how to set up and use evaluation metrics, maybe with an example.\n\nI remember from previous interactions that there are different ways to display numeric values like completion_tokens or total_tokens.

Define evaluation metrics (e.g., `loss`, `accuracy`, `precision`).\n2. Set up a baseline for comparison.\n3. Display numeric values in formats like:\n   - **Integer** (for exact counts)\n   - **Percentage** (for relative values)\n   - **Multiplier** (for large numbers)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Example: Displaying Numeric Values\n\n#### 1. Define Metrics\n- In Weave, define a metric like this:\n\n```python\nmetrics = {\n    \"loss\": 0.0,\n    \"accuracy\": 0.95,\n    \"precision\": 0.82\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Set Up Baseline\n- Click the **Baseline** button in the topbar.\n- Select an object to set as the baseline.\n\n#### 3. Display Numeric Values\n\nAfter setting a baseline, you can display values like:\n\n- **Integer**: `loss = 0.0` \u2192 shows exact values.\n- **Percentage**: `accuracy = 95%` \u2192 shows relative performance.\n- **Multiplier**: `precision = 82\u00d7` \u2192 for large numbers.\n\n#### Example Output:\n```\nBaseline: accuracy = 95%\nLoss: 0.0\nPrecision: 82\u00d7\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddea How to Use Weave\n\n1. **Define Metrics** in the evaluation setup.\n2. **Set a Baseline Object** (e.g., an object with known values).\n3. **Apply Values** using the UI or API to display results.\n\nThis framework is ideal for tracking progress and comparing model performance across different stages of training.

Let me start by recalling what I know about Weave.\n\nFirst, I remember that Weave is a tool for creating and managing data pipelines. It's similar to Apache Airflow but with more features like integration with other systems. So, operations in Weave would be the steps or tasks you perform within your pipeline.\n\nThe user might not be familiar with the terms, so I should explain what an operation is in simple terms. An operation could be a step in a pipeline that processes data, transforms it, or performs some action. They might need examples to understand better.\n\nNext, how to create them? I think operations can be created via the UI or through code. Since the user hasn't specified a language, maybe they're using an interface like Weave's web app. So, steps would include navigating to the operation creation page and filling in details such as name, description, parameters, etc.\n\nI should also mention that creating an operation involves setting up the necessary parameters and defining the action it performs. Including examples of common operations could help them visualize what they're doing. For instance, a data transformation step or a logging operation.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there are any specific steps mentioned in the documentation provided earlier. The user's previous questions were about creating baselines and ordering objects, so perhaps they're building pipelines similar to those. Including that context might help them see how operations relate to their own pipeline structure.\n\nAlso, making sure to explain that operations can be created using either the UI or code, depending on the setup. If they're using an interface, steps would be straightforward, but if they need to write code, then there's a coding aspect.\n\nI should also note that operations have dependencies, like inputs and outputs, so users need to define those as well. Maybe include a simple example with placeholders for parameters.\n\nFinally, wrap it up by summarizing the process: creating an operation involves setting up the name, description, parameters, and action, all through the Weave interface or code.\n</think>\n\nWeave operations are the **steps or tasks** you perform within your data pipelines. They define how data is processed, transformed, or acted upon in a sequence of steps.\n\n---\n\n### What Are Weave Operations?\n\n- An operation defines:\n  - A **name** (e.g., \"Data Transformation\")\n  - A **description**\n  - Inputs and outputs\n  - The action it performs\n\n---\n\n### How to Create an Operation\n\n#### **1. Using the Web App Interface**\n\n- Open your Weave interface.\n- Navigate to the **\"Operations\"** section (usually in a dashboard or pipeline editor).\n- Click on the **\"Create Operation\"** button.\n- Fill out the following details:\n  - **Name**: Describe what the operation does (e.g., \"Data Transformation\").\n  - **Description**: Briefly explain the purpose.\n  - **Inputs/Outputs**:\n    - List any required inputs and their types (e.g., numeric, string).\n    - Define outputs or dependencies.\n- Click **\"Create Operation\"**.\n\n#### **2. Using Code (Optional)**\n\nIf you're using an integrated system like Airflow, you can define operations in your code:\n\n```python\nfrom weave import operation\n\n# Create a data transformation operation\nop = operation(\n    name=\"Data Transformation\",\n    description=\"Transforms input data into output format.\",\n    inputs=[\n        {\"name\": \"input_data\", \"type\": \"string\"},\n        {\"name\": \"timestamp\", \"type\": \"datetime\"}\n    ],\n    outputs=[\n        {\"name\": \"output_result\", \"type\": \"string\"}\n    ]\n)\n```\n\nOnce created, you can assign it to a pipeline step.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Common Operations\n\n- **Data Transformation**: Converts raw data into structured formats.\n- **Logging**: Records events in the system.\n- **Input/Output Handling**: Ensures data flows correctly between steps.\n\nLet me know if you'd like examples of how to define specific operations!",

Weave is a tool that allows users to run and debug their own code, right? So tracing calls would mean figuring out the execution path of the code, maybe to find out where the LLM is being called from.\n\nFirst, I need to explain that Weave's trace feature is designed for debugging. Users can use the trace button to see the execution steps. That's straightforward. But maybe they're not familiar with that feature. I should mention that by default, trace doesn't show all the steps, just the main function. So the user can toggle it on or off to see a detailed breakdown.\n\nThen, I should think about the tools involved. They might be using Jupyter or VS Code. If they're using a code editor, the trace would show the code execution path.

This will show you the execution path of the code.\n3. **Toggle Trace**: If you want a detailed breakdown, toggle the **Trace** flag on or off to reveal more steps.\n\n### Example:\n- If you're using a Jupyter notebook:\n  - Click the **Trace** button to see the execution path.\n- If you're using VS Code:\n  - Use the **Trace** button in the editor to view the code flow.\n\n**Note**: The trace is only available in specific environments (e.g., Jupyter notebooks or VS Code extensions).

This helps visualize metrics like `completion_tokens` or `total_tokens`.\n\nThis allows you to track and analyze orderings of LLM calls for better performance or debugging.",
