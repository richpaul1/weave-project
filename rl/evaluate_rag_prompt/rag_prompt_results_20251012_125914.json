Using W&B Inference, you can build and trace LLM applications using live open-source models without setting up your own infrastructure or managing API keys from multiple providers.

This allows you to swap between supported models by only changing the slug, and make use of any existing code you have that was written to use the OpenAI API.\n\n\n**CURRENT_QUESTION:** How do I trace my LLM calls with Weave?

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking how to trace their LLM calls with Weave. Let me check the context provided.\n\nFrom the sources, we know that Weave allows tracing of LLM calls automatically. The user mentioned including relevant images and examples. The sources mention that when they run the code, Weave traces the call, logs inputs, outputs, latency, token usage, and provides a link to view the trace in the Weave UI.\n\nSo, the answer should guide the user through the process of setting up Weave and W&B Inference, then using the trace functionality. They need to install necessary libraries like weave and openai. Also, mention the steps in the quickstart guide. Include the images from the Weave Calls 1, 2, and 3. Maybe provide an example of the trace link. Make sure to reference the prerequisites mentioned earlier, like the W&B account and API key.\n\nWait, the user's question is how to trace, so the answer should walk them through the steps, maybe with an example of the trace link. Also, check if there are any specific images needed. The sources mention those images, so the answer should include them as examples. Make sure to mention the necessary libraries and installation steps as well.\n</think>\n\nTo trace your LLM calls with Weave, follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n1. **Set Up Weave and W&B Inference**:\n   - Access the [W&B Weave quickstart](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/quickstart-inference) to create an account and obtain your W&B API key.\n   - Install required libraries:  \n     ```bash\n     pip install weave openai\n     ```\n\n2. **Initiate a LLM Call**:\n   - Use a Python script that calls your LLM (e.g., using the `openai` library) to run a function. For example:\n     ```python\n     import weave\n     # Example code to run a LLM call\n     model = weave.openai.Model(\"llama-3-8b-instruct\")\n     response = model.generate(\"Your query here\")\n     print(\"Response:\", response)\n     ```\n\n3. **Observe Tracing**:\n   - Weave will automatically trace your LLM call, logging:\n     - Inputs\n     - Outputs\n     - Latency\n     - Token usage\n     - Metadata (e.g., execution context, exceptions)\n\n4. **View the Trace**:\n   - Access the Weave UI to view your trace, which includes:\n     - **Calls** (parent-child relationships in a trace)\n     - **Metadata** (duration, exceptions, LLM usage, etc.)\n     - Example:  \n       ![Call Trace](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/assets/images/calls_macro-d9e28cdfc97ad0117e08dbfdc7230206.png)  \n       ![Basic Call](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/assets/images/basic_call-59ec9aa0e8ad59dbc2746a4693b2f0c8.png)  \n       ![Calls Filter](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/assets/images/calls_filter-764602b7a2706e7c889829b86886d6d5.png)\n\n5. **Compare Models**:\n   - Use the Weave UI to compare multiple LLM models by filtering calls or examining performance metrics.\n\n### Example:\n```python\nimport weave\n\n# Initialize W&B Inference API\napi_key = \"your_api_key_here\"\nmodel = weave.openai.Model(\"llama-3-8b-instruct\")\n\n# Run a simple LLM call\nresponse = model.generate(\"What is the capital of France?\")\n\n# Print results\nprint(\"LLM Response:\", response)\n```\n\nEnsure you have the W&B account and API key set up before proceeding.",
