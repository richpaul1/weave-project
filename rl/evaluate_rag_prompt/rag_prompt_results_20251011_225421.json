Let me check the context provided.\n\nFrom the sources, there's a mention of using W&B Weave to track LLM calls. The steps include setting up the account, installing dependencies, and using the openai library. Also, there are examples with screenshots mentioned in the sources. \n\nThe user wants relevant images and examples. Let me recall the relevant sections. In the Tracing Basics guide, there are images showing calls, traces, and filters. The user might need to look at those. Also, the quickstart guides mention using W&B Inference without external API keys, so the setup is straightforward.\n\nI should explain that tracing works by using the provided API key, installing necessary libraries, and running the setup steps. Include the example code from the sources. Make sure to reference the images mentioned in the sources. Also, mention that the user can view traces in the Weave UI. Need to keep the answer accurate and based on the context provided, without adding personal information.\n</think>\n\nTo trace your LLM calls with **Weave**, follow these steps and include the relevant **images and examples**:\n\n1. **Set Up Weave**  \n   - Access the [W&B Weave quickstart](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/quickstart-inference) to create your account and obtain a **W&B API key**.  \n   - Install the required libraries:  \n     ```bash\n     pip install weave openai\n     ```\n\n2. **Run a Basic LLM Application**  \n   - Use live models hosted on **W&B Inference** (e.g., `llama-3-1-8b`).  \n   - Example:  \n     ```python\n     from weave import call\n\n     # Example call (replace with your model and inputs)\n     call(\n         model=\"llama-3-1-8b\",\n         input=\"Your input text\",\n         output=\"Your output text\",\n         trace=True\n     )\n     ```\n\n3. **View Traces in Weave**  \n   - After running the call, you\u2019ll see a trace in the Weave UI, which includes:  \n     - Inputs  \n     - Outputs  \n     - Metadata (like latency, token usage, or LLM usage)  \n     - A call tree (parent-child relationships) for tracing execution context.  \n\n4. **Use Filters**  \n   - Use filters like \"Calls\", \"Filters\", or \"Tags\" to analyze specific traces.  \n\n**Relevant Images**:\n- **Call Tree**: ![Call Tree](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/assets/images/calls_filter-764602b7a2706e7c1a4d917b8d3014ca.png)  \n- **Trace Example**: ![Trace Example](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/assets/images/basic_call-59ec9aa0e8ad59dbc2746a4693b2f0c8.png)  \n\nBy following these steps, you\u2019ll track your LLM applications seamlessly using Weave.

However, in the \"Tracing Basics\" section, there are screenshots provided. The user might need to refer to those images.\n\nThe answer should guide them through setting up Weave and W&B Inference, maybe include an example code snippet.
