"""
Functional test for streaming response accumulation bug

This test specifically covers the bug where streaming responses were not being
accumulated correctly due to incorrect event structure parsing.

Bug: The streaming endpoint was looking for event.get("content") but the actual
events have structure {"type": "response", "data": {"text": "..."}}

This test mocks the RAG service to return events with the correct structure
and verifies that the accumulation works properly.
